### CT4: Gold Prices

We were asked to perform the following tasks:

**Task 1:** Read the data as a dataframe.

**Task 2:** Summarize the observations from the basic statistics you apply on the dataset. (Number of columns/rows; number of missing values -if any; datatype of each column; measures of central tendency and variability; etc).

**Task 3:** Convert data in each column into an appropriate data type.

**Task 4:** Create visualizations that show the distribution of each numerical column.

**Task 5:** Group the data by year, considering the average price in each year.

**Task 6:** Plot the data you got as an output from group by with time on the horizontal axis and gold price on the vertical. Be sure to provide a title and labels for the horizontal and vertical axes.

**Task 7:** Visualize the gold price in the last ten years (choose the appropriate chart).

**Task 8:** Create, then train a regression model, then use it to predict the gold price in the next five time periods.
